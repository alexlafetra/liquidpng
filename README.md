# liquidPNG

LiquidPNG is an online tool designed for exploring text and image distortion. I started it as part of an ongoing project translating electronic data into physical form, but it kind of grew into a technical challenge around designing a web application.

Run it [here :^)](https://alexlafetra.github.io/liquidpng)!

(Things can be very buggy on mobile browsers, where floating-point textures aren't as well supported).

LiquidPNG uses [p5js](https://p5js.org/) alongside WebGL to distort images (lots of love to p5js), and is a totally open source project released under the MIT software license. Feel free to reuse, contribute, or copy this project.
